There’s no culture and no art.
There’s no logic and no technology.
There’s only labels,
labels for everything,
labels to put things in boxes,
labels to stop you from doing things
and you let it.
Stop trying to categorise everything and pretend some things are opposed to one another.
Stop trying to categorising yourself into types and exclude yourself from doing things because it’s not what you do.
Stop thinking art and science are infinitely different. 
Stop thinking you are an artist. 
Stop thinking you are a scientist. 
Stop thinking about who you are.
We are humans, we are creative.
We create culture. We create art. 
We solve problems. We create things that solve problems.
What I’m really saying is this:
we can be both artist and scientist,
we can be both analytical and illogical,
we can use technology in any ways we can imagine.
It is not the technology that limits what you can do, it is your will that limits you.
It is not the definition that decide the qualities of things, it is the things that defined the definition.
Stop thinking technology is in the realm of the engineer, it is not.
The rest of us who are not engineers have as much to do with technology as engineers.
You can create with technology the same way you can create with a pencil.
Have you created poetry with code? You can.
Have you created drawings with code? You can.
If you refuse to explore the cultural use of technology,
then the only machine here is you.
